# Monopoly_GA

This is an implementation of Monopoly Board Game to simulate wich profile would be better at.

At first we have 4 profiles:
-Cautious: only buys a property if his remaining balance is equal or greater than a value;
-Demmanding: only buys the property if his rental value is superior to a certain value;
-Impulsive: if he has coins enough, buys the property;
-Random: decides randomly to buy or not a property.

Each value used in this simulation can be set in de `config.js` file.

## Game Mechanics Implemented
-Buy property
-Pay rent
-Bankrupcy
-Pay taxes
-Full set

## Game Mechanics That May Be Implemented In The Future
-Metro Station
-Go to jail
-Luck cards
-Safe cards
-Banker

Soon a Genetic Algorithm will be implemented to simulated another player.
